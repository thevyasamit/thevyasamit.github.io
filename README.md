# My presence on the web #
We are in a world where almost everthing is virtual. 
Just like in the earlier days of the civilization people used to have their home/mailing address and I believe now is the time where people should have their e-address or a personal web address for their presence in this vast electronic and web dominating world in addition to their physical presence. 
So, this is my personal webpage and I'll be updating it as and when I get time.
